## Running Online

### CodeSandbox

Use the live CodeSandbox link under [Demo](#demo).

### GitHub Pages

You can also host the built app directly from this repository using GitHub Pages:

1. **Add homepage to `package.json`**

   ```json
   {
     "homepage": "https://immy2good.github.io/Keeper-App-in-React"
   }
   ```
2. **Install the `gh-pages` package**

   ```bash
   npm install --save gh-pages
   ```
3. **Add deploy scripts to `package.json`**

   ```json
   {
     "scripts": {
       "predeploy": "npm run build",
       "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
     }
   }
   ```
4. **Deploy to GitHub Pages**

   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

After deployment, the app will be available at `https://immy2good.github.io/Keeper-App-in-React`.

Alternatively, you can enable Pages in GitHub settings (Settings → Pages) and select the `gh-pages` branch as the source.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

The `npm run deploy` command (from above) will create a `gh-pages` branch and push the production build to it. GitHub Pages then serves the app automatically.
